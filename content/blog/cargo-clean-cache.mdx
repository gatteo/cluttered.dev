howToSteps:
  - "Confirm where Cargo stores its cache (usually ~/.cargo/ on macOS/Linux) and make sure no cargo build/run is currently running."
  - "Check cache size with du (or cargo-cache) so you know what you’ll reclaim."
  - "Clean safely: run `cargo cache --autoclean` or delete only `~/.cargo/registry/cache`, `~/.cargo/registry/src`, and `~/.cargo/git/checkouts`."
  - "Rebuild when needed—Cargo will re-download/re-extract dependencies on demand."

If you searched **“cargo clean cache”**: `cargo clean` only removes your project’s `target/` directory. It does **not** clear Cargo’s global download + git caches (which can grow to **50GB+**).

This guide covers the safest ways to clear Cargo’s **registry cache**, **git cache**, and **downloaded crates**—plus what *not* to delete.

## TL;DR: Fastest Safe Cargo Cache Cleanup

### Option 1: Use cargo-cache (Recommended)

```bash
# Install once
cargo install cargo-cache

# Smart cleanup (safe defaults)
cargo cache --autoclean
```

### Option 2: Manual Cleanup (Safe Folders)

```bash
# Downloads + extracted sources
rm -rf ~/.cargo/registry/cache ~/.cargo/registry/src

# Git dependency checkouts (not the bare DB)
rm -rf ~/.cargo/git/checkouts
```

**Important**:
- **Never delete** `~/.cargo/bin` (your installed tools)
- Don’t delete caches while `cargo build` / `cargo run` is running

## Where Is Cargo Cache Located?

On macOS/Linux, Cargo stores its global cache in `~/.cargo/`:

```
~/.cargo/
├── registry/
│   ├── index/          # Crate registry metadata (crates.io index)
│   ├── cache/          # Downloaded .crate files
│   └── src/            # Extracted crate source code
├── git/
│   ├── db/             # Cloned git repositories
│   └── checkouts/      # Checked out commits/branches
└── bin/                # Installed binaries (cargo install)
```

On Windows, Cargo’s default location is typically:

```
C:\Users\<you>\.cargo\
```

If you set `CARGO_HOME`, Cargo uses that path instead.

## How to Check Cargo Cache Size

Before cleaning, see how much space Cargo is using:

```bash
du -sh ~/.cargo/registry ~/.cargo/git
```

For a detailed breakdown:

```bash
du -sh ~/.cargo/registry/index
du -sh ~/.cargo/registry/cache
du -sh ~/.cargo/registry/src
du -sh ~/.cargo/git
```

### Typical Cargo Cache Sizes

| Cache Location | After 6 Months | After 1+ Year |
|----------------|----------------|---------------|
| registry/index | 200-500MB | 500MB-1GB |
| registry/cache | 1-5GB | 5-15GB |
| registry/src | 2-8GB | 10-30GB |
| git/db + checkouts | 500MB-2GB | 2-10GB |
| **Total** | **4-15GB** | **20-50GB+** |

## How to Clean Cargo Cache Manually

### Clear Cargo Registry Source Cache

The `registry/src` folder contains extracted source code. Safe to delete:

```bash
rm -rf ~/.cargo/registry/src
```

Cargo re-extracts sources from `.crate` files when needed.

### Clear Cargo Registry Download Cache

Remove downloaded `.crate` archives:

```bash
rm -rf ~/.cargo/registry/cache
```

Cargo re-downloads crates on your next build.

### Clear Cargo Git Cache

For git dependencies:

```bash
rm -rf ~/.cargo/git/checkouts
```

### Clean All Cargo Cache (Nuclear Option)

Remove everything except installed binaries:

```bash
rm -rf ~/.cargo/registry
rm -rf ~/.cargo/git
```

This is safe but requires re-downloading all dependencies.

## Using cargo-cache Tool (Recommended)

The `cargo-cache` tool provides smarter, selective cleanup:

```bash
cargo install cargo-cache
```

If you already have it installed, you can update it with:

```bash
cargo install cargo-cache --locked
```

### Check Cargo Cache Size with cargo-cache

```bash
cargo cache
```

Output:

```
Cargo cache '~/.cargo':

Total:                               12.34 GB
  45 installed binaries:            234.56 MB
  Registry: crates.io               11.89 GB
    Registry index:                 456.78 MB
    4523 crate archives:              3.45 GB
    4523 crate source directories:    7.98 GB
  Git db:                           123.45 MB
    12 bare git repos
  Git checkouts:                     89.01 MB
    34 git repo checkouts
```

### Cargo Cache Autoclean

The easiest way to clean Cargo cache:

```bash
cargo cache --autoclean
```

This removes:
- Old crate source directories
- Orphaned git checkouts
- Duplicate crate versions

### Cargo Cache Aggressive Cleanup

For deeper cleaning:

```bash
cargo cache --autoclean-expensive
```

### Remove Specific Cargo Cache Items

```bash
# Remove all source directories
cargo cache -r src

# Remove old crate versions (keep latest)
cargo cache --remove-dir all-ref-cache

# Remove git checkouts
cargo cache -r git-checkouts
```

## What's Safe to Delete in Cargo Cache?

| Location | Safe to Delete? | What Happens |
|----------|-----------------|--------------|
| registry/src | ✅ Yes | Re-extracted from cache |
| registry/cache | ✅ Yes | Re-downloaded on build |
| registry/index | ⚠️ Careful | Slow next cargo update |
| git/checkouts | ✅ Yes | Re-checked out on build |
| git/db | ⚠️ Careful | Full re-clone needed |
| bin/ | ❌ Keep | Your installed tools |

**Best approach**: Use `cargo cache --autoclean` for smart decisions.

## Cargo Clean vs Cargo Cache Clean

Many developers confuse these:

| Command | What It Cleans | Scope |
|---------|----------------|-------|
| `cargo clean` | target/ directory | Current project only |
| `cargo cache --autoclean` | ~/.cargo/ caches | Global, all projects |

For full Rust cleanup, you need both:

```bash
cargo clean                    # Current project's target/
cargo cache --autoclean       # Global registry + git cache
```

## How to Clean Rust Target Directories

Don't forget per-project build artifacts. Each `target/` folder can be 2-10GB:

```bash
# Clean current project
cargo clean

# Find all target directories
find ~/projects -name "target" -type d 2>/dev/null | head -20

# See sizes
find ~/projects -name "target" -type d -exec du -sh {} \; 2>/dev/null | sort -hr | head -20
```

For a complete guide on target directories, see our [Rust target directory guide](/blog/rust-target-directory).

## Automate Rust Cleanup with Cluttered

[Cluttered](/download) handles complete Rust cleanup automatically:

- **Scans all Rust projects**: Finds every target/ directory on your system
- **Shows Cargo cache size**: Visualizes registry and git cache usage
- **Identifies dormant projects**: Knows which projects are inactive
- **Safe deletion**: Moves to Trash instead of permanent deletion
- **Scheduled cleanup**: Pro feature for automatic maintenance

Unlike manual cleanup, Cluttered understands project context and won't clean active projects.

## Rust Cleanup Best Practices

### 1. Monthly Cargo Cache Maintenance

```bash
cargo cache --autoclean
```

### 2. Use sccache for Shared Compilation

```bash
cargo install sccache
export RUSTC_WRAPPER=sccache
```

Reduces duplicate compiled artifacts across projects.

### 3. Pin Dependency Versions

In `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
serde = "=1.0.193"  # Exact version reduces cache churn
```

### 4. Clean Before Backups

```bash
cargo clean                    # Current project
cargo cache --autoclean       # Global caches
```

### 5. Move Cargo Cache to Larger Drive

```bash
export CARGO_HOME=/path/to/larger/drive/.cargo
```

## How Much Disk Space Can You Recover?

| Developer Profile | Cargo Cache | target/ Dirs | Total Recovery |
|-------------------|-------------|--------------|----------------|
| Hobbyist | 2-5GB | 10-20GB | 12-25GB |
| Professional | 5-15GB | 30-60GB | 35-75GB |
| Heavy Rust User | 15-30GB | 80-150GB | 95-180GB |

Most Rust developers recover 20-50GB from complete cleanup.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Does cargo clean cache affect Cargo.lock?

No. `Cargo.lock` is in your project directory, not the cache. Cache cleanup never affects it.

### Will I need to re-download all dependencies?

Only when you build each project. Dependencies download on-demand, not all at once.

### Is it safe to delete Cargo cache while cargo is running?

No. Wait for any `cargo build` or `cargo run` commands to finish first.

### How do I clean rustup cache?

Rustup has separate cache in `~/.rustup/`:

```bash
# Check rustup size
du -sh ~/.rustup

# Remove old toolchains
rustup toolchain list
rustup toolchain uninstall 1.74.0
```

### What's the difference between cargo clean and cargo cache?

`cargo clean` removes your project's compiled output (target/). `cargo cache` is a third-party tool that manages Cargo's global download cache (~/.cargo/).

### Is there a built-in “cargo clean all” command?

Not really. `cargo clean` is **per-project**. To clear global caches, use `cargo cache --autoclean` (recommended) or delete folders under `~/.cargo/` as shown above.

## Conclusion

Cleaning Cargo cache requires more than just `cargo clean`. The global registry and git caches in `~/.cargo/` can grow to 50GB or more, requiring `cargo-cache` or manual cleanup.

For complete Rust cleanup including both caches and target directories, use `cargo cache --autoclean` monthly or automate with [Cluttered](/download).
