JavaScript's `node_modules` folder is notorious for its size. A typical React project can easily have 200+ MB of dependencies, and that's for a relatively simple app.

If you're working on multiple projects, those folders add up fast. Here's how to clean them safely.

## The Manual Approach

You could manually find and delete old `node_modules` folders:

```bash
# Find all node_modules folders
find ~ -name "node_modules" -type d -prune

# Delete them (be careful!)
find ~ -name "node_modules" -type d -prune -exec rm -rf {} +
```

**Warning**: This approach is risky. You might delete dependencies for a project you're actively working on.

## The Smart Approach

Before deleting any `node_modules` folder, you should ask:

1. **When was this project last modified?** If it was 6 months ago, it's probably safe to clean.
2. **Is this a git repository?** If so, are there uncommitted changes?
3. **Can you easily reinstall?** Is there a `package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock`?

## What Cluttered Does Differently

Cluttered automates this entire process:

1. **Scans your entire drive** for Node.js projects
2. **Checks git status** to ensure no uncommitted work
3. **Analyzes activity** using file modification times
4. **Shows clear indicators** - green (safe), yellow (caution), red (active)
5. **Deletes to Trash** so you can recover if needed

## Real-World Results

A typical developer machine has:
- 10-20 Node.js projects
- Average `node_modules` size: 300 MB
- Total recoverable: 3-6 GB (or more)

And the best part? Running `npm install` in any project will restore it instantly.

## Tips for Keeping Things Clean

1. **Use a single global cache**: npm and yarn both support global caching
2. **Delete old projects**: If you haven't touched it in a year, archive and delete it
3. **Use Cluttered regularly**: Set up automatic cleaning for inactive projects

## Conclusion

You don't need to let `node_modules` folders consume your disk. With the right approach, you can keep your machine clean while staying productive.
