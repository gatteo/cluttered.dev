Docker caches everything—build layers, images, containers, and volumes. Running `docker system prune` is the fastest way to clear Docker cache, but there are more targeted commands depending on what you need to clean.

This guide covers every Docker cache clearing command and when to use each.

## Check Docker Cache Size

First, see how much space Docker is using:

```bash
docker system df
```

Output:

```
TYPE            TOTAL     ACTIVE    SIZE      RECLAIMABLE
Images          45        12        18.5GB    12.3GB (66%)
Containers      23        3         2.1GB     1.9GB (90%)
Local Volumes   12        5         5.2GB     3.1GB (59%)
Build Cache     -         -         8.4GB     8.4GB
```

The "RECLAIMABLE" column shows what you can safely clear—often 20-50GB.

For detailed view:

```bash
docker system df -v
```

## Docker Cache Types Explained

### Docker Build Cache

Created by `docker build`. Each Dockerfile instruction caches a layer:

```bash
docker builder du
```

### Docker Image Cache

Pulled and built images. Shared layers between images accumulate:

```bash
docker images
```

### Docker Container Cache

Stopped containers keep their writable layer:

```bash
docker ps -a
```

### Docker Volume Cache

Named volumes persist data between container runs:

```bash
docker volume ls
```

## How to Clear Docker Build Cache

Build cache often grows largest. Clear it with:

```bash
docker builder prune
```

### Clear All Docker Build Cache

Including active cache entries:

```bash
docker builder prune -a
```

### Clear Docker Build Cache Without Confirmation

```bash
docker builder prune -f
```

### Keep Recent Docker Build Cache

Clear cache older than 24 hours:

```bash
docker builder prune --filter "until=24h"
```

Keep last 5GB:

```bash
docker builder prune --keep-storage 5GB
```

## How to Clear Docker Image Cache

### Remove Dangling Docker Images

Untagged images from old builds:

```bash
docker image prune
```

Always safe, typically recovers several GB.

### Remove All Unused Docker Images

Images not used by any container:

```bash
docker image prune -a
```

**Note**: Requires re-pulling images later.

### Remove Docker Images by Age

```bash
docker image prune -a --filter "until=720h"  # 30 days
```

### Remove Specific Docker Images

```bash
docker rmi nginx:latest
docker rmi abc123def456
docker rmi nginx redis postgres
```

## How to Clear Docker Container Cache

Remove stopped containers:

```bash
docker container prune
```

### View Stopped Containers First

```bash
docker ps -a --filter "status=exited"
```

### Remove Specific Containers

```bash
docker rm container_name_or_id
docker rm -f running_container  # Force
```

## How to Clear Docker Volume Cache

Remove orphaned volumes:

```bash
docker volume prune
```

**Warning**: This deletes data. Check volumes first:

```bash
docker volume ls
docker volume inspect volume_name
```

## Docker System Prune: Clear All Docker Cache

The fastest way to clear Docker cache:

```bash
docker system prune
```

Removes:
- Stopped containers
- Dangling images
- Unused networks
- Dangling build cache

### Clear All Docker Cache Including Volumes

Maximum cleanup:

```bash
docker system prune -a --volumes
```

**Warning**: Aggressive. Removes all unused images and volumes.

### Docker System Prune Without Confirmation

```bash
docker system prune -f
docker system prune -af --volumes  # Nuclear option
```

## Docker Cache Command Reference

| Command | What It Clears | Safe? | Space Recovery |
|---------|----------------|-------|----------------|
| `docker builder prune` | Build cache | ✅ Yes | 2-10GB |
| `docker image prune` | Dangling images | ✅ Yes | 1-5GB |
| `docker image prune -a` | Unused images | ⚠️ Mostly | 5-20GB |
| `docker container prune` | Stopped containers | ✅ Usually | 100MB-2GB |
| `docker volume prune` | Unused volumes | ⚠️ Data loss! | 1-10GB |
| `docker system prune` | All dangling | ✅ Yes | 5-15GB |
| `docker system prune -a --volumes` | Everything unused | ⚠️ Aggressive | 10-50GB |

## Docker Clean Build (Build Without Cache)

Sometimes you want a fresh build without clearing cache:

```bash
# Build without cache
docker build --no-cache -t myapp .

# Also pull fresh base image
docker build --no-cache --pull -t myapp .
```

Useful for:
- Debugging build issues
- Ensuring reproducible builds
- CI/CD pipelines

## Docker BuildKit Cache

If using BuildKit (Docker's modern build engine):

```bash
# Check BuildKit cache
docker buildx du

# Clear BuildKit cache
docker buildx prune

# Clear all BuildKit data
docker buildx prune -a
```

## Docker Cache Location

### macOS (Docker Desktop)
```
~/Library/Containers/com.docker.docker/Data/vms/0/data/
```

### Windows (Docker Desktop)
```
%LOCALAPPDATA%\Docker\wsl\data\
```

### Linux
```
/var/lib/docker/
```

**Don't manually delete these files**—use Docker commands instead.

## Automate Docker Cleanup

### Cron Job for Docker Cache

```bash
# Weekly cleanup - add to crontab -e
0 3 * * 0 docker system prune -f >> /var/log/docker-prune.log 2>&1
```

### Docker Compose Cleanup

```bash
docker-compose down           # Stop, remove containers/networks
docker-compose down -v        # Also remove volumes
docker-compose down --rmi all # Also remove images
```

### CI/CD Docker Cleanup

```yaml
# GitHub Actions
- name: Docker cleanup
  if: always()
  run: docker system prune -f
```

## Docker Disk Space: Reclaimable Space Explained

The `docker system df` output shows "RECLAIMABLE" space:

```
TYPE            SIZE      RECLAIMABLE
Images          18.5GB    12.3GB (66%)
```

This means:
- **18.5GB total** images on disk
- **12.3GB reclaimable** (unused images)
- **6.2GB in use** (by running/stopped containers)

To reclaim that 12.3GB:

```bash
docker image prune -a
```

## How Cluttered Helps with Docker Cleanup

[Cluttered](/download) makes Docker cleanup visual and safe:

- **Visual overview**: See all Docker resources at a glance
- **Reclaimable space**: Instantly see recovery potential
- **Smart detection**: Identifies safe vs. risky deletions
- **Project context**: Knows which images belong to which projects
- **Multi-tool**: Cleans Docker alongside Node, Rust, Go, and more

Unlike command-line prunes, Cluttered lets you selectively clean.

## Docker Best Practices to Reduce Cache Growth

### 1. Use Specific Image Tags

```dockerfile
# Bad - accumulates versions
FROM node:latest

# Good - consistent version
FROM node:20.10-slim
```

### 2. Use Slim/Alpine Base Images

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.12          # 900MB
FROM python:3.12-slim     # 150MB
FROM python:3.12-alpine   # 50MB
```

### 3. Multi-Stage Docker Builds

```dockerfile
FROM node:20 AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

FROM node:20-slim
COPY --from=builder /app/dist ./dist
CMD ["node", "dist/index.js"]
```

### 4. Use .dockerignore

```
node_modules
.git
*.log
.env
coverage
dist
```

### 5. Combine RUN Commands

```dockerfile
RUN apt-get update \
    && apt-get install -y curl \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
```

## Docker Disk Space Recovery Expectations

| Docker Usage | Total Cache | Reclaimable |
|--------------|-------------|-------------|
| Light (5-10 images) | 5-10GB | 3-5GB |
| Medium (20-30 images) | 15-30GB | 10-20GB |
| Heavy (50+ images) | 40-80GB | 25-50GB |
| CI/CD Workers | 50-100GB | 30-70GB |

Most developers recover 10-30GB from Docker cleanup.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Will clearing Docker cache break running containers?

No. Prune commands only affect unused resources. Running containers and their images are protected.

### How often should I clear Docker cache?

Monthly for most developers. CI/CD systems should clean after each job or daily.

### Does Docker cache clearing affect Docker Compose projects?

Only stopped services. Running services are unaffected.

### Can I recover deleted Docker images?

Only if pushed to a registry. Local deletions are permanent.

### Why does Docker cache grow so fast?

Common causes:
- Building many image versions
- Using `:latest` tags
- Missing `.dockerignore`
- Never running prune commands

### What's the difference between docker prune commands?

- `docker system prune` - cleans containers, images, networks, build cache
- `docker builder prune` - only build cache
- `docker image prune` - only images
- `docker container prune` - only containers
- `docker volume prune` - only volumes (data!)

### How do I clear Docker cache on Mac?

Same commands work. Docker Desktop manages storage in a VM:

```bash
docker system prune -a --volumes
```

For Docker Desktop specifically, you can also: Settings > Resources > Disk image size.

## Conclusion

Clearing Docker cache is essential maintenance. Start with `docker builder prune` for quick wins, use `docker system prune` for routine cleanup, and reserve `docker system prune -a --volumes` for when you need maximum space recovery.
