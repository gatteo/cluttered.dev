The `node_modules` folder is notorious for consuming massive amounts of disk space. A single React project can have 300MB+ of dependencies, and across 20 projects, you're looking at 6GB or more.

Here's how to safely delete node_modules folders and reclaim that space.

## How to Find All node_modules Folders

### Using Terminal

```bash
# Find all node_modules directories
find ~ -name "node_modules" -type d -prune 2>/dev/null

# Show sizes
find ~ -name "node_modules" -type d -prune -exec du -sh {} \; 2>/dev/null | sort -hr
```

### Check Total node_modules Size

```bash
# Total size of all node_modules
find ~ -name "node_modules" -type d -prune -exec du -sh {} \; 2>/dev/null | awk '{sum += $1} END {print sum "GB total"}'
```

## How to Delete node_modules

### Delete Single node_modules Folder

```bash
rm -rf /path/to/project/node_modules
```

### Delete All node_modules Folders (Dangerous)

```bash
find ~ -name "node_modules" -type d -prune -exec rm -rf {} + 2>/dev/null
```

**Warning**: This deletes ALL node_modules folders, including active projects. You'll need to run `npm install` in every project.

### Delete node_modules Older Than 30 Days

```bash
find ~ -name "node_modules" -type d -prune -mtime +30 -exec rm -rf {} + 2>/dev/null
```

Safer, but still doesn't check for uncommitted work.

## The Problem with Manual Deletion

Manual deletion is risky because it doesn't consider:

1. **Active projects**: You might delete dependencies for a project you're currently working on
2. **Uncommitted changes**: The project might have work that depends on specific dependency versions
3. **Monorepos**: Deleting root node_modules might break child packages
4. **Lock files**: Without checking for package-lock.json, you might not restore exact versions

## Safe node_modules Cleanup Checklist

Before deleting any node_modules folder, verify:

| Check | Why It Matters |
|-------|----------------|
| Last modified date | Older = safer to delete |
| Git status | No uncommitted changes? |
| Has package-lock.json? | Can restore exact versions |
| Is project archived? | Might never need it again |
| Monorepo structure? | Don't break workspaces |

## Using npkill (Node.js Tool)

The `npkill` tool helps find and delete node_modules interactively:

```bash
npx npkill
```

Features:
- Shows all node_modules with sizes
- Interactive selection
- Sorts by size or last modified

Limitations:
- Doesn't check git status
- No project activity analysis
- Manual selection required

## Using Cluttered (Recommended)

[Cluttered](/download) provides intelligent node_modules cleanup:

1. **Scans entire drive** for Node.js projects
2. **Checks git status** to protect uncommitted work
3. **Analyzes activity** using file modification times
4. **Shows clear indicators**: Green (safe), Yellow (caution), Red (active)
5. **Deletes to Trash** for easy recovery

### Why Cluttered Is Safer

| Feature | Manual/npkill | Cluttered |
|---------|---------------|-----------|
| Finds all node_modules | ✅ | ✅ |
| Shows sizes | ✅ | ✅ |
| Checks git status | ❌ | ✅ |
| Detects active projects | ❌ | ✅ |
| Trash-first deletion | ❌ | ✅ |
| Cleans other ecosystems | ❌ | ✅ |

## How Much Space Does node_modules Use?

Typical node_modules sizes by project type:

| Project Type | Average Size | With Dev Dependencies |
|--------------|--------------|----------------------|
| Simple website | 50-100MB | 100-200MB |
| React app | 200-400MB | 300-600MB |
| Next.js project | 300-500MB | 500-800MB |
| Monorepo | 500MB-2GB | 1-3GB |
| Electron app | 400-800MB | 600MB-1.2GB |

Across 10-20 projects, this easily totals **5-15GB**.

## Reinstalling Dependencies After Cleanup

After deleting node_modules, reinstall when needed:

```bash
# Using npm
npm install

# Using yarn
yarn install

# Using pnpm
pnpm install
```

If you have a lock file (package-lock.json, yarn.lock, pnpm-lock.yaml), exact dependency versions are restored.

## Preventing node_modules Bloat

### 1. Use pnpm Instead of npm

pnpm uses hard links to share packages between projects:

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
pnpm install
```

Can reduce total disk usage by 50-80%.

### 2. Regularly Clean Dormant Projects

Monthly cleanup of projects you haven't touched keeps things manageable.

### 3. Archive Old Projects

Before archiving to git or backup:

```bash
rm -rf node_modules
git add .
git commit -m "Archive project"
```

Never store node_modules in version control or backups.

### 4. Use .npmrc for Smaller Installs

```ini
# .npmrc
ignore-scripts=true
fund=false
audit=false
```

Reduces install time but not disk space.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is it safe to delete node_modules?

Yes, if you have a package.json and package-lock.json. Running `npm install` restores everything.

### Will deleting node_modules break my project?

Only temporarily. Your next `npm install` restores dependencies. The project won't run until then.

### How do I delete node_modules on Windows?

```powershell
# PowerShell
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force node_modules

# Or use npx
npx npkill
```

### Should I commit node_modules to git?

No. Always add `node_modules` to `.gitignore`. It's reproducible from package-lock.json.

### How often should I clean node_modules?

Monthly for most developers. More often if you work on many projects or have limited disk space.

### What about global npm packages?

Those are in a different location and aren't affected by project cleanup:

```bash
npm list -g --depth=0
npm cache clean --force
```
