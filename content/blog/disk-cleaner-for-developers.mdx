Generic disk cleaners like CleanMyMac don't understand developer files. They can't tell if a `node_modules` folder is from an active project or one you abandoned a year ago. Cluttered is built specifically to solve this problem.

## What Makes Cluttered Different?

Unlike generic disk cleaners, Cluttered understands developer workflows:

| Feature | Generic Cleaners | Cluttered |
|---------|------------------|-----------|
| Understands node_modules | ❌ | ✅ |
| Knows Rust target/ directories | ❌ | ✅ |
| Detects active vs dormant projects | ❌ | ✅ |
| Respects uncommitted git changes | ❌ | ✅ |
| Supports 12+ dev ecosystems | ❌ | ✅ |

## How Much Disk Space Can Developers Recover?

A typical developer machine accumulates:

- **20-50GB** in node_modules across projects
- **10-30GB** in Rust target directories
- **20-100GB** in Xcode DerivedData
- **5-50GB** in Docker images and containers

**Total: 50-200GB** of recoverable space on most developer machines.

## Supported Development Ecosystems

Cluttered scans and cleans artifacts from:

1. **Node.js** - node_modules directories
2. **Rust** - target/ directories and Cargo cache
3. **Xcode** - DerivedData, Device Support, Archives
4. **Docker** - Images, containers, volumes, build cache
5. **Python** - virtualenv, .venv, __pycache__
6. **Go** - Module cache, build cache
7. **Android** - Gradle cache, build directories
8. **Ruby** - Bundler cache, gem installations
9. **PHP** - Composer vendor directories
10. **Java** - Maven .m2 cache, Gradle cache
11. **Elixir** - _build, deps directories
12. **.NET** - bin, obj directories

## How Cluttered Works

### Step 1: Smart Scanning

Cluttered scans your entire drive using parallel filesystem traversal. It identifies projects by their structure—package.json for Node, Cargo.toml for Rust, .xcodeproj for Xcode.

### Step 2: Project Intelligence

For each project, Cluttered analyzes:

- **Git status**: Are there uncommitted changes?
- **Last modified**: When was this project last touched?
- **IDE markers**: Is this project open in an IDE?
- **Size**: How much space is the build folder using?

### Step 3: Safe Cleanup

Projects are categorized:

- **Green (Safe)**: Dormant projects with no uncommitted changes
- **Yellow (Caution)**: Recently modified but no uncommitted work
- **Red (Active)**: Currently in use or has uncommitted changes

### Step 4: Trash-First Deletion

Everything goes to Trash first. If you realize you needed something, you can recover it for 30 days.

## Getting Started with Cluttered

1. [Download Cluttered](/download) (free)
2. Open the app and click "Scan"
3. Review found projects and their sizes
4. Select what to clean (start with dormant projects)
5. Click "Clean"

The entire process takes under 5 minutes for most machines.

## Free vs Pro Features

### Free (Unlimited)
- Full scanning capabilities
- All 12+ ecosystem support
- Project intelligence
- Manual cleanup
- Trash-first safety

### Pro ($4.99/month)
- Scheduled automatic scans
- Auto-clean dormant projects
- Priority support
- Early access to new features

Most developers get full value from the free version. Pro is for "set it and forget it" automation.

## Why Developers Love Cluttered

> "I recovered 87GB on my MacBook Pro. Most of it was old Rust projects I forgot about." — Senior Developer

> "Finally, a tool that understands that node_modules is safe to delete but I shouldn't lose my uncommitted work." — Frontend Engineer

> "The Xcode cleanup alone was worth it. 45GB of DerivedData from projects I haven't touched in months." — iOS Developer

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is Cluttered safe to use?

Yes. Cluttered never deletes uncommitted git changes, moves everything to Trash first, and lets you preview exactly what will be deleted.

### Will cleaning slow down my builds?

Only temporarily. Deleted artifacts are regenerated on your next build. For dormant projects, there's no impact until you work on them again.

### Does Cluttered work with all project types?

Cluttered supports 12+ ecosystems covering most developer workflows. If your ecosystem isn't supported, [let us know](https://github.com/cluttered-app/feedback).

### Is Cluttered free?

Yes, the core functionality is completely free with no limits on manual cleanup. Pro adds automation features.

### Does it work on Apple Silicon Macs?

Yes. Cluttered is a universal binary optimized for both Intel and Apple Silicon Macs.
