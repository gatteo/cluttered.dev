Docker can consume 20-50GB or more without you realizing it. Images, containers, volumes, and build cache accumulate over time. This guide shows you how to check Docker disk usage and reclaim that space.

## How to Check Docker Disk Space Usage

### Quick Overview

```bash
docker system df
```

Output:

```
TYPE            TOTAL     ACTIVE    SIZE      RECLAIMABLE
Images          45        12        18.5GB    12.3GB (66%)
Containers      23        3         2.1GB     1.9GB (90%)
Local Volumes   12        5         5.2GB     3.1GB (59%)
Build Cache     -         -         8.4GB     8.4GB
```

**RECLAIMABLE** shows how much you can safely free—in this example, 25GB+.

### Detailed View

```bash
docker system df -v
```

Shows individual images, containers, and volumes with sizes.

### Check Image Sizes

```bash
docker images --format "table {{.Repository}}\t{{.Tag}}\t{{.Size}}" | sort -k3 -hr
```

### Check Container Disk Usage

```bash
docker ps -as
```

### Check Volume Sizes

```bash
docker system df -v | grep -A 100 "Local Volumes"
```

## Where Does Docker Store Data?

### macOS (Docker Desktop)

```
~/Library/Containers/com.docker.docker/Data/vms/0/data/Docker.raw
```

This single file contains all Docker data. It grows but doesn't shrink automatically.

### Linux

```
/var/lib/docker/
├── overlay2/      # Image layers
├── containers/    # Container data
├── volumes/       # Named volumes
├── image/         # Image metadata
└── buildkit/      # Build cache
```

### Windows (Docker Desktop with WSL 2)

```
%LOCALAPPDATA%\Docker\wsl\data\ext4.vhdx
```

## What Consumes Docker Disk Space?

### 1. Docker Images

Every image you've pulled or built stays until you remove it.

```bash
# List all images
docker images

# List dangling (untagged) images
docker images -f "dangling=true"
```

Typical usage: **5-30GB**

### 2. Docker Containers

Stopped containers keep their writable layer.

```bash
# List all containers including stopped
docker ps -a

# List only stopped containers
docker ps -a -f "status=exited"
```

Typical usage: **100MB-5GB**

### 3. Docker Volumes

Named volumes persist data between container runs. Orphaned volumes remain after containers are deleted.

```bash
docker volume ls
```

Typical usage: **1-20GB**

### 4. Docker Build Cache

BuildKit caches every layer from `docker build`.

```bash
docker builder du
```

Typical usage: **2-15GB**

## How to Free Docker Disk Space

### Remove Dangling Images (Safest)

```bash
docker image prune
```

Removes untagged images—leftovers from builds. Always safe.

### Remove All Unused Images

```bash
docker image prune -a
```

Removes images not used by any container. You'll need to re-pull them.

### Remove Stopped Containers

```bash
docker container prune
```

Removes all containers not currently running.

### Remove Unused Volumes

```bash
docker volume prune
```

**Warning**: Deletes data! Check volumes before pruning:

```bash
docker volume inspect volume_name
```

### Remove Build Cache

```bash
docker builder prune
```

Clears build cache. Next builds will be slower initially.

### Remove Everything Unused

```bash
docker system prune
```

Removes:
- Stopped containers
- Dangling images
- Unused networks
- Dangling build cache

### Maximum Cleanup (Nuclear)

```bash
docker system prune -a --volumes
```

Removes ALL unused data including images and volumes. Use carefully.

## Docker Disk Space Commands Reference

| Command | What It Removes | Typical Recovery |
|---------|-----------------|------------------|
| `docker image prune` | Dangling images | 1-5GB |
| `docker image prune -a` | All unused images | 5-20GB |
| `docker container prune` | Stopped containers | 100MB-2GB |
| `docker volume prune` | Unused volumes | 1-10GB |
| `docker builder prune` | Build cache | 2-15GB |
| `docker system prune` | All dangling | 5-15GB |
| `docker system prune -a --volumes` | Everything unused | 10-50GB |

## Docker Desktop Disk Space (macOS/Windows)

Docker Desktop uses a virtual disk that grows but doesn't automatically shrink.

### Check Docker Desktop Disk Size

**macOS:**
```bash
ls -lh ~/Library/Containers/com.docker.docker/Data/vms/0/data/Docker.raw
```

**Windows:**
```powershell
Get-Item "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Docker\wsl\data\ext4.vhdx" | Select-Object Length
```

### Shrink Docker Desktop Disk

After pruning, the virtual disk may still be large. To reclaim space:

**macOS:**
1. Docker Desktop → Settings → Resources
2. Reduce disk image size
3. Apply & Restart

**Windows:**
```powershell
# Stop Docker Desktop first
wsl --shutdown
Optimize-VHD -Path "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Docker\wsl\data\ext4.vhdx" -Mode Full
```

## Automating Docker Disk Cleanup

### Cron Job

```bash
# Weekly cleanup - add to crontab -e
0 3 * * 0 docker system prune -f >> /var/log/docker-prune.log 2>&1
```

### Docker Compose Integration

```bash
# After stopping services
docker-compose down -v --rmi local
```

### CI/CD Pipelines

```yaml
# GitHub Actions
- name: Docker cleanup
  if: always()
  run: docker system prune -f
```

## How Cluttered Helps with Docker

[Cluttered](/download) makes Docker cleanup visual and safe:

- **See all Docker resources** at a glance
- **Reclaimable space** shown clearly
- **Safe vs risky** deletions identified
- **Project context** for images
- **Multi-ecosystem** cleanup

Unlike command-line prunes, Cluttered lets you selectively clean.

## Best Practices to Reduce Docker Disk Usage

### 1. Use Specific Image Tags

```dockerfile
# Bad - accumulates versions
FROM node:latest

# Good - single version
FROM node:20-slim
```

### 2. Use Slim Base Images

| Image | Size |
|-------|------|
| python:3.12 | 900MB |
| python:3.12-slim | 150MB |
| python:3.12-alpine | 50MB |

### 3. Multi-Stage Builds

```dockerfile
FROM node:20 AS builder
RUN npm ci && npm run build

FROM node:20-slim
COPY --from=builder /app/dist ./dist
```

### 4. Use .dockerignore

```
node_modules
.git
*.log
.env
```

Prevents large files from entering build context.

### 5. Regular Cleanup

Monthly `docker system prune` prevents extreme accumulation.

## Docker Disk Space Recovery Expectations

| Docker Usage | Typical Usage | Reclaimable |
|--------------|---------------|-------------|
| Light (5-10 images) | 5-10GB | 3-5GB |
| Medium (20-30 images) | 15-30GB | 10-20GB |
| Heavy (50+ images) | 40-80GB | 25-50GB |
| CI/CD workers | 50-100GB | 30-70GB |

Most developers recover **10-30GB** from Docker cleanup.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why is Docker using so much disk space?

Common causes:
- Old images never removed
- Stopped containers not pruned
- Build cache accumulation
- Orphaned volumes
- Using `:latest` tags (each pull cached separately)

### Will cleaning Docker break my running containers?

No. Prune commands only affect unused resources. Running containers and their images are protected.

### How often should I clean Docker?

Monthly for most developers. CI/CD systems should clean daily or after each job.

### Can I recover deleted Docker images?

Only if they're in a registry. Local deletions are permanent—you'll need to re-pull.

### Does Docker Desktop reclaim space automatically?

No. The virtual disk grows but doesn't shrink. After pruning, you may need to manually compact it.

### What's the difference between docker system prune options?

- `docker system prune` - Removes dangling resources only
- `docker system prune -a` - Also removes unused images
- `docker system prune --volumes` - Also removes volumes (data!)
- `docker system prune -a --volumes` - Maximum cleanup

## Conclusion

Docker disk space management requires regular attention. Between images, containers, volumes, and build cache, Docker easily consumes 20-50GB or more.

Use `docker system df` to monitor usage, and `docker system prune` for routine cleanup. For visual, safe cleanup across Docker and all your development tools, try [Cluttered](/download).
