If you're a developer, you know the frustration of running out of disk space. Between `node_modules`, Rust's `target/` directories, Xcode's DerivedData, and Docker images, your disk fills up faster than you'd expect.

## The Problem

A typical developer machine accumulates:

- **20-50GB** in node_modules across projects
- **10-30GB** in Rust target directories
- **20-100GB** in Xcode build artifacts
- **5-50GB** in Docker images and containers

That's potentially **100GB+** of space you could reclaim!

## Enter Cluttered

Cluttered is designed specifically for developers. Unlike generic cleaning tools, it understands your projects and safely cleans build artifacts while protecting your active work.

### Key Features

1. **Multi-Ecosystem Support** - Scans Node.js, Rust, Xcode, Docker, Python, Go, and more
2. **Smart Detection** - Identifies active vs dormant projects
3. **Safe by Default** - Never touches uncommitted changes
4. **Satisfying UX** - Because cleaning should feel good

## Getting Started

1. Download Cluttered from our [download page](/download)
2. Open the app and click "Scan"
3. Review the found projects
4. Select what to clean
5. Click "Clean" and watch the magic happen

> **Tip:** Start with dormant projects (red indicators) - these are safe to clean first.

## Conclusion

Stop manually hunting for `node_modules` folders. Let Cluttered handle it while you focus on what matters - writing code.
