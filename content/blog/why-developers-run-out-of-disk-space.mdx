If you're a developer, you've probably seen that dreaded notification: "Your disk is almost full." It always seems to happen at the worst possible moment—during a critical build, while downloading a large dataset, or right before a demo.

But have you ever stopped to wonder where all that space actually goes?

## The Usual Suspects

### 1. node_modules: The Black Hole

Every JavaScript developer knows the pain. A single `npm install` can pull in hundreds of megabytes of dependencies. Multiply that across 10-20 projects, and you're looking at 20-40 GB easily.

The real kicker? Many of those `node_modules` folders are in projects you haven't touched in months.

### 2. Rust's target Directory

Rust is fantastic for performance, but those compile artifacts add up fast. A single release build can exceed 10 GB. If you're working on multiple Rust projects, the `target` directories alone might be consuming 50+ GB.

### 3. Xcode's DerivedData

iOS and macOS developers know this one well. Xcode's `DerivedData` folder quietly accumulates build artifacts, caches, and indexes. It's not uncommon for this folder to reach 30-50 GB.

### 4. Docker Images and Containers

Docker makes development easier, but those images pile up. Old versions, dangling images, unused containers—it all adds up. A typical development machine can easily have 20-30 GB tied up in Docker data.

## Why Traditional Tools Don't Help

Generic disk cleaning utilities like CleanMyMac or DaisyDisk are great for finding large files, but they don't understand developer workflows. They might show you a massive folder, but they can't tell you:

- Is this project still active?
- Is it safe to delete these artifacts?
- Will deleting this break anything?

That's why we built Cluttered. It understands the difference between a project you're actively working on and one you abandoned six months ago.

## The Smart Approach

Instead of blindly deleting large folders, Cluttered:

1. **Scans intelligently** - Recognizes project structures across 12+ ecosystems
2. **Checks activity** - Uses git history and file modification times to determine if a project is active
3. **Protects your work** - Never suggests deleting uncommitted changes
4. **Makes it reversible** - Everything goes to Trash first

## How Much Space Can You Recover?

Based on our testing across dozens of developer machines:

- **Average recovery**: 50-100 GB
- **Heavy users**: 150+ GB
- **Fastest cleanup**: Under 5 minutes

The best part? You can reclaim all this space without losing any actual code or work.

## Conclusion

Disk space management doesn't have to be stressful. With the right tool, you can keep your machine clean without worrying about breaking anything.
