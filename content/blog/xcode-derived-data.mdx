Xcode's DerivedData folder grows silently in the background, often consuming 30-50GB or more. If you're an iOS or macOS developer wondering where your disk space went, DerivedData is likely the culprit.

This guide covers everything about DerivedData: where it is, what it contains, and how to safely delete it.

## Where Is Xcode DerivedData Located?

DerivedData lives at:

```
~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/
```

To open in Finder:

```bash
open ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData
```

Or through Xcode:
1. **Xcode → Settings** (⌘,)
2. **Locations** tab
3. Click the arrow next to DerivedData path

## What Is Inside DerivedData?

```
DerivedData/
├── MyApp-abcdefghijklm/        # Per-project folder
│   ├── Build/
│   │   ├── Intermediates.noindex/
│   │   └── Products/
│   ├── Index/
│   ├── Logs/
│   └── TextIndex/
├── AnotherProject-xyz123/
├── ModuleCache.noindex/         # Shared Swift modules
└── SymbolCache.noindex/         # Debug symbols
```

### Per-Project Contents

| Folder | Contents | Size Impact |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| Build/Products/ | Compiled apps, frameworks | Large |
| Build/Intermediates/ | Object files, partial builds | Very large |
| Index/ | Code completion, search index | Medium |
| Logs/ | Build and test logs | Small |

### Shared Caches

| Folder | Contents |
|--------|----------|
| ModuleCache.noindex | Precompiled Swift modules |
| SymbolCache.noindex | Debug symbols for crash logs |

## Why Does Xcode DerivedData Get So Large?

### 1. Multiple Build Configurations

Each combination creates separate artifacts:
- Debug + iPhone 14 Simulator
- Debug + iPhone 15 Pro Simulator
- Release + Any iOS Device
- Debug + My iPhone

Four destinations = 4x the build products.

### 2. SwiftUI Previews

Every SwiftUI preview generates its own build. Heavy preview usage creates significant overhead.

### 3. Swift Module Cache

Swift caches compiled modules across projects. This cache grows with:
- Number of dependencies
- Swift version changes
- Xcode updates

### 4. Index Data

Xcode maintains searchable indexes for autocomplete and navigation. Large codebases = large indexes.

## Typical Xcode DerivedData Sizes

| Project Type | Single Project | Multiple Projects |
|--------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Small app | 500MB - 2GB | - |
| Medium app | 2GB - 5GB | - |
| Large/Enterprise | 5GB - 15GB | - |
| All projects | - | 20GB - 50GB+ |

iOS developers commonly have **30-50GB** in DerivedData.

## How to Delete Xcode DerivedData

### Method 1: Delete via Finder

```bash
rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/*
```

Or open in Finder and delete:

```bash
open ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData
```

### Method 2: Delete Specific Project

```bash
# Find your project's folder
ls ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/ | grep "MyApp"

# Delete it
rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/MyApp-*
```

### Method 3: Via Xcode Menu

1. **Product → Clean Build Folder** (⌘⇧K)

Note: This only cleans the current project's build products, not the entire DerivedData folder.

### Method 4: Via Xcode Settings

1. Xcode → Settings (⌘,)
2. Locations tab
3. Click arrow next to DerivedData path
4. Delete folders in Finder

### Method 5: Using Cluttered

[Cluttered](/download) provides visual DerivedData cleanup:

1. See all Xcode projects with DerivedData
2. View size per project
3. Identify active vs dormant projects
4. Clean multiple projects at once
5. Trash-first deletion for safety

## Is It Safe to Delete Xcode DerivedData?

**Yes, always safe.** DerivedData contains only generated files. Xcode recreates everything on your next build.

### What Happens After Deletion

| What You Lose | How It's Restored |
|---------------|-------------------|
| Build products | Next build regenerates |
| Code index | Re-indexed on project open |
| Preview cache | Regenerated when previewing |
| Module cache | Recompiled from source |

### Symptoms That Deleting Fixes

Clear DerivedData when you experience:

- ❌ "Command SwiftCompile failed"
- ❌ Autocomplete not working
- ❌ Indexing stuck at percentage
- ❌ SwiftUI previews failing
- ❌ "Module not found" for existing modules
- ❌ Mysterious build errors after Xcode update

Many Xcode issues resolve after clearing DerivedData.

## Other Xcode Caches to Clean

### iOS Device Support

```
~/Library/Developer/Xcode/iOS DeviceSupport/
```

Contains debug symbols for each iOS version you've connected. Can be 2-5GB per version.

**Safe to clean**: Versions you no longer test on.

```bash
# Check size
du -sh ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/iOS\ DeviceSupport/*

# Delete old versions (e.g., iOS 15.x when you only need 17+)
rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/iOS\ DeviceSupport/15.*
```

### Archives

```
~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Archives/
```

Every App Store submission creates an archive. Each can be 1-5GB.

**Careful**: Archives can't be regenerated. Only delete if you're certain you won't need them for debugging or re-submission.

### Simulators

```
~/Library/Developer/CoreSimulator/Devices/
```

Each simulator has its own disk image with installed apps.

```bash
# List simulators
xcrun simctl list

# Delete unavailable simulators
xcrun simctl delete unavailable
```

## Total Xcode Disk Space Usage

| Location | Typical Size | Safe to Delete? |
|----------|--------------|-----------------|
| DerivedData | 20-50GB | ✅ Yes |
| iOS DeviceSupport | 10-30GB | ✅ Old versions |
| Archives | 5-30GB | ⚠️ Careful |
| Simulators | 10-50GB | ✅ Unused |
| **Total** | **45-160GB** | - |

## Automating Xcode Cleanup

### Shell Alias

Add to `~/.zshrc`:

```bash
alias xcode-clean='rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/*'
```

### Scheduled Cleanup

```bash
# Monthly cleanup (add to crontab -e)
0 0 1 * * rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/*
```

**Caution**: Aggressive—cleans active projects too.

### Cluttered Pro (Recommended)

Cluttered Pro offers smart scheduled cleanup:
- Only cleans dormant projects
- Preserves active project caches
- Sends notifications before cleaning

## Xcode DerivedData Best Practices

### 1. Clean After Xcode Updates

Major Xcode updates invalidate existing caches anyway. Clean DerivedData after updating.

### 2. Clean Monthly

Regular cleanup prevents extreme accumulation. 5 minutes monthly saves emergency situations.

### 3. Keep Active Project Caches

Don't clean projects you're actively working on. Rebuilding takes time.

### 4. Never Delete Archives Carelessly

Archives can't be regenerated. Keep them until you're certain you don't need them.

### 5. Clean Before Backups

Don't back up 50GB of regenerable data:

```bash
rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/*
```

## Space Recovery Expectations

| What You Clean | Space Recovered | Rebuild Time |
|----------------|-----------------|--------------|
| Single project | 500MB - 5GB | 1-10 minutes |
| All DerivedData | 10GB - 50GB | Varies per project |
| + DeviceSupport | 5GB - 20GB | Re-downloads as needed |
| + Old Archives | 5GB - 30GB | **Cannot regenerate** |

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Will deleting DerivedData delete my source code?

No. Your source code is in your project folder. DerivedData only contains generated files.

### Do I need to quit Xcode first?

Recommended but not required. Xcode handles missing DerivedData gracefully, but quitting prevents conflicts.

### Will I lose my build settings?

No. Build settings are in your .xcodeproj or .xcworkspace, not DerivedData.

### How often should I clear DerivedData?

Monthly for most developers. After Xcode updates. Whenever you experience mysterious build issues.

### What about the ModuleCache folder?

The ModuleCache.noindex folder is shared across projects. Deleting it forces all projects to recompile Swift modules—takes longer but sometimes fixes cross-project issues.

### Can I move DerivedData to an external drive?

Yes. In Xcode Settings → Locations, you can set a custom DerivedData location.

## Conclusion

Xcode DerivedData is essential for fast builds, but dormant projects don't need gigabytes of cached artifacts. Regular cleanup of DerivedData, iOS DeviceSupport, and old Simulators can recover **30-80GB** or more.
