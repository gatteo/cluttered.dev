Cluttered 1.1.0 introduces Pro features with unlimited cleanup and automation capabilities.

## New: Cluttered Pro

- **Unlimited Cleanup**: Free users can now clean up to 20 GB per week. Pro removes this limit entirely
- **One-Time Purchase**: Pro is a single $29 payment—no subscriptions, no recurring fees
- **License Activation**: Simple in-app license key activation

## Automation (Pro)

- **Scheduled Scans**: Set Cluttered to scan automatically on your schedule
- **Auto-Clean Rules**: Automatically clean dormant projects based on your criteria
- **Smart Notifications**: Get notified when there's significant space to recover

## Improvements

- **Faster Scanning**: Optimized filesystem traversal for quicker scan results
- **Better Docker Detection**: Improved detection of Docker images and build cache
- **Refined Activity Detection**: More accurate project activity indicators

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue where some Xcode DerivedData folders weren't detected
- Fixed scan progress not updating in certain edge cases
- Improved handling of symlinked directories

## Notes

The 20 GB weekly limit for free users resets every 7 days. This allows casual users to keep their disk clean while Pro users get unlimited access for heavy development workflows.
