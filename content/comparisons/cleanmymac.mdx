## Overview

CleanMyMac is one of the most popular Mac cleaning apps, and for good reason—it's polished, easy to use, and great for general system maintenance.

But if you're a developer, CleanMyMac misses the biggest sources of disk usage on your machine.

## What CleanMyMac Cleans

CleanMyMac excels at:

- **System junk**: Caches, logs, language files
- **Mail attachments**: Downloaded email attachments
- **iTunes junk**: Old iOS updates, broken downloads
- **Large files**: General large file finder
- **Malware**: Security scanning and removal

## What CleanMyMac Misses

CleanMyMac doesn't understand developer workflows:

| Artifact | CleanMyMac | Cluttered |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| node_modules | ❌ Ignored | ✅ Scanned |
| Rust target/ | ❌ Ignored | ✅ Scanned |
| Xcode DerivedData | ⚠️ Partial | ✅ Full support |
| Python venvs | ❌ Ignored | ✅ Scanned |
| Docker images | ❌ Ignored | ✅ Scanned |
| .git objects | ❌ Ignored | ✅ Scanned |

## Real-World Comparison

We tested both apps on a MacBook Pro with 5 years of development projects:

| Metric | CleanMyMac | Cluttered |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| Space found | 18 GB | 87 GB |
| Developer artifacts | 2 GB | 82 GB |
| Scan time | 45 sec | 28 sec |

**Cluttered found 4.8x more reclaimable space.**

## Safety Comparison

Both apps move files to Trash, but only Cluttered:

- ✅ Checks git status before suggesting cleanup
- ✅ Detects active development projects
- ✅ Shows project activity indicators
- ✅ Understands lockfiles and dependencies

## When to Use Each

**Use CleanMyMac for:**
- General system maintenance
- Browser cache cleanup
- Malware scanning
- Application uninstallation

**Use Cluttered for:**
- Development artifact cleanup
- node_modules management
- Build cache cleanup
- Recovering space from old projects

## Conclusion

CleanMyMac and Cluttered solve different problems. For developers, the ideal setup is using both:

1. **Cluttered** for development artifacts (weekly)
2. **CleanMyMac** for system maintenance (monthly)

But if you only have budget for one, and you're a developer, Cluttered will save you significantly more space.
