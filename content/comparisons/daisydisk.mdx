## Overview

DaisyDisk is a beautiful disk space analyzer with an iconic sunburst visualization. It's great for understanding what's using your space, but it stops there.

Cluttered goes further—it tells you what's safe to clean.

## What DaisyDisk Does

DaisyDisk excels at:

- **Visualization**: Beautiful sunburst chart of disk usage
- **Speed**: Very fast initial scan
- **Navigation**: Easy drilling into folder hierarchies
- **Discovery**: Finding unexpected large files

## The Problem with DaisyDisk for Developers

DaisyDisk shows you have 20 GB in a folder called "target", but it can't tell you:

- Is this a Rust project or something else?
- Is there uncommitted work in this project?
- When was this project last active?
- Is it safe to delete?

You're left to figure this out yourself for every folder.

## How Cluttered is Different

| Capability | DaisyDisk | Cluttered |
|------------|-----------|-----------|
| Disk visualization | ✅ Beautiful | ⚠️ Functional |
| Project detection | ❌ None | ✅ 12+ ecosystems |
| Safety analysis | ❌ None | ✅ Git-aware |
| Activity detection | ❌ None | ✅ Built-in |
| One-click cleanup | ❌ Manual | ✅ Automated |

## Workflow Comparison

### With DaisyDisk:
1. Run scan
2. Navigate to large folder
3. Wonder "what is this?"
4. Open Terminal, check git status
5. Decide if safe to delete
6. Delete manually
7. Repeat for each folder

### With Cluttered:
1. Run scan
2. See all projects with activity indicators
3. Select inactive projects
4. Click "Clean"
5. Done

## When to Use Each

**Use DaisyDisk when:**
- You need to understand overall disk usage
- You're looking for unexpected large files
- You want a general-purpose disk analyzer

**Use Cluttered when:**
- You specifically want to clean development artifacts
- You need safety guarantees for your projects
- You want actionable recommendations, not just data

## They Work Great Together

The ideal workflow:

1. Use **DaisyDisk** to get a high-level overview
2. Use **Cluttered** to clean development artifacts safely
3. Use **DaisyDisk** again to find any remaining large files

## Conclusion

DaisyDisk answers "what's using my space?" Cluttered answers "what can I safely delete?"

For developers, the second question is more important. That's why we built Cluttered.
