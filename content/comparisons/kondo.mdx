## Overview

kondo is a Rust-based command-line tool that cleans project build artifacts across multiple programming languages. It's fast, supports many ecosystems, and has a loyal following among CLI enthusiasts.

So how does it compare to Cluttered?

## What kondo Does Well

kondo excels at:

- **Speed**: Written in Rust, very fast scanning
- **Multi-ecosystem**: Supports Node, Rust, Python, Go, and more
- **Lightweight**: Single binary, no dependencies
- **Scriptable**: Easy to integrate into shell scripts

## Feature Comparison

| Feature | kondo | Cluttered |
|---------|-------|-----------|
| Multi-ecosystem | ✅ 15+ | ✅ 12+ |
| GUI interface | ❌ | ✅ |
| CLI interface | ✅ | Pro only |
| Git protection | ❌ | ✅ |
| Activity detection | ❌ | ✅ |
| Trash support | ❌ | ✅ |
| Undo capability | ❌ | ✅ |

## Safety Comparison

This is where the tools differ significantly:

| Safety Feature | kondo | Cluttered |
|----------------|-------|-----------|
| Uncommitted changes warning | ❌ | ✅ |
| Active project detection | ❌ | ✅ |
| Recent activity indicators | ❌ | ✅ |
| Move to Trash first | ❌ | ✅ |
| Undo deletion | ❌ | ✅ |

kondo permanently deletes files. Cluttered moves them to Trash first.

## Interface Philosophy

**kondo** follows Unix philosophy: do one thing well, in the terminal.

```bash
# kondo usage
kondo ~/projects
```

**Cluttered** provides a visual interface with:
- Project cards with activity indicators
- Space breakdown per ecosystem
- One-click cleanup with confirmation
- History of all cleaning operations

## When to Use Each

**Use kondo if:**
- You strongly prefer CLI tools
- You want to script cleanup in cron jobs
- You trust yourself not to delete active projects
- You don't need undo capability

**Use Cluttered if:**
- You want visual project overview
- You need safety features and undo
- You prefer clicking over typing
- You want to see project activity before cleaning

## Performance Comparison

Both tools are fast:

| Metric | kondo | Cluttered |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| Scan 1000 projects | ~2s | ~5s |
| Memory usage | ~10MB | ~50MB |
| Startup time | Instant | ~1s |

kondo is faster due to its minimal Rust binary. Cluttered trades some speed for features and visual interface.

## Conclusion

kondo and Cluttered target similar problems but different users. kondo is for CLI power users who want speed. Cluttered is for developers who want safety and visual feedback.

If you're comfortable with permanent deletion and love the terminal, kondo is excellent. If you want peace of mind and a visual overview, Cluttered is the better choice.
