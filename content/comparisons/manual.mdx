## Overview

You're a developer. You know how to delete folders. Why would you need a tool for that?

It's a fair question. Let's break down the real cost of manual cleanup versus using Cluttered.

## The Manual Approach

Here's what manual cleanup typically looks like:

```bash
# Find node_modules
find ~/projects -name "node_modules" -type d

# Check each one manually
cd ~/projects/old-project
ls -la node_modules  # How big is it?
git status           # Any uncommitted changes?
stat package.json    # When was this last modified?

# Decide and delete
rm -rf node_modules

# Repeat for every project...
```

## Time Investment

Let's do the math for a typical developer with 20 projects:

| Task | Time per project | Total for 20 projects |
|------|-----------------|----------------------|
| Find directories | - | 5 min |
| Check each project | 2 min | 40 min |
| Decide what to clean | 1 min | 20 min |
| Run deletion commands | 30 sec | 10 min |
| **Total** | | **75 min** |

With Cluttered:

| Task | Time |
|------|------|
| Scan | 30 sec |
| Review and select | 3 min |
| Clean | 30 sec |
| **Total** | **4 min** |

**Cluttered is 18x faster.**

## Ecosystems Multiply the Problem

Manual cleanup for one ecosystem is tedious. Now multiply by 12:

- node_modules (npm, yarn, pnpm)
- target/ (Rust)
- DerivedData (Xcode)
- venv (Python)
- build/ (Gradle, Maven)
- vendor/ (Go, Ruby, PHP)
- ...and more

Each ecosystem has different:
- Directory names
- Safe deletion patterns
- Detection of active projects
- Restoration commands

## What Manual Cleanup Misses

| Factor | Manual | Cluttered |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Hidden directories | Often missed | Always found |
| Nested projects | Requires recursive search | Automatic detection |
| Project activity | Manual git status | Instant indicators |
| Space tracking | Manual calculation | Running totals |
| History | No record | Full log |

## The Real Risk

Manual cleanup has higher error potential:

- **Wrong directory**: `rm -rf` in the wrong folder is catastrophic
- **Active project**: Deleting while building causes issues
- **No undo**: Gone means gone
- **Muscle memory**: Dangerous when tired

Cluttered prevents these by:
- Showing clear project names and paths
- Detecting active builds and git status
- Moving to Trash before permanent deletion
- Providing full history and undo

## When Manual Makes Sense

Manual cleanup is fine if:

- You have only 1-2 projects
- You work in a single ecosystem
- You enjoy terminal archaeology
- You never make mistakes while tired

## When Cluttered Makes Sense

Cluttered pays for itself if:

- You have more than 5 projects
- You work across multiple ecosystems
- You value your time
- You want safety rails

## The Monthly Calculation

| Approach | Monthly Time | Annual Time |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| Manual (weekly) | 5 hours | 60 hours |
| Cluttered | 20 min | 4 hours |
| **Time saved** | **4.7 hours/month** | **56 hours/year** |

That's more than a full work week saved per year.

## Conclusion

Manual cleanup works, but it doesn't scale. Every new project and every new language adds to the maintenance burden.

Cluttered automates the tedious parts while keeping you in control. It's not about whether you *can* do it manually—it's about whether you *should*.

Your time is better spent building things, not hunting for node_modules.
