## Overview

npkill is a popular command-line tool specifically designed to find and delete node_modules directories. It's fast, focused, and does one thing well.

But if you're a polyglot developer working across multiple ecosystems, npkill only solves part of your disk space problem.

## What npkill Does Well

npkill excels at:

- **Fast scanning**: Quickly finds all node_modules
- **Interactive deletion**: Arrow keys to navigate and delete
- **Size display**: Shows space used by each directory
- **Terminal-native**: Works in any terminal

## What npkill Misses

npkill is JavaScript-only:

| Artifact | npkill | Cluttered |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| node_modules | ✅ | ✅ |
| Rust target/ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Xcode DerivedData | ❌ | ✅ |
| Python venvs | ❌ | ✅ |
| Docker images | ❌ | ✅ |
| Go modules | ❌ | ✅ |
| Java target/build | ❌ | ✅ |
| .NET bin/obj | ❌ | ✅ |

## Real-World Comparison

Testing on a developer machine with 5 years of mixed projects:

| Metric | npkill | Cluttered |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Space found | 32 GB | 87 GB |
| Ecosystems | 1 | 12+ |
| Project detection | Basic | Smart |
| Activity indicators | No | Yes |

**Cluttered found 2.7x more reclaimable space.**

## Safety Comparison

| Feature | npkill | Cluttered |
|---------|--------|-----------|
| Git status check | No | Yes |
| Activity detection | No | Yes |
| Trash support | No | Yes |
| Undo capability | No | Yes |

## When to Use Each

**Use npkill if:**
- You only work with JavaScript
- You prefer CLI tools exclusively
- You want a quick, one-command solution

**Use Cluttered if:**
- You work across multiple languages
- You want smart project detection
- You prefer visual interfaces
- You want safety features and undo

## Can They Work Together?

Yes! Some developers use npkill for quick JavaScript cleanups and Cluttered for comprehensive multi-ecosystem cleaning.

However, Cluttered handles node_modules just as well, so running both is redundant for most users.

## Conclusion

npkill is excellent for what it does—cleaning node_modules from the terminal. But for developers working across multiple languages and frameworks, Cluttered provides a more comprehensive solution.

If JavaScript is your only ecosystem, npkill is a solid choice. For everyone else, Cluttered saves significantly more space.
