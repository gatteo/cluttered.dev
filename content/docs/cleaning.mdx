## The Cleaning Process

Cluttered's cleaning process is designed to be safe and reversible. Here's how it works:

1. **Select projects** to clean
2. **Review** the cleanup preview
3. **Confirm** the deletion
4. **Files move to Trash** (not permanently deleted)

## Selecting Projects

### Individual Selection

Click on project cards to select them. Selected projects show a checkmark and are highlighted.

### Bulk Selection

Use keyboard shortcuts for faster selection:

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| ⌘A | Select all projects |
| ⌘⇧A | Deselect all |
| Click + Shift | Select range |

### Smart Selection (Pro)

Pro users can use smart filters:

- **Dormant projects**: Inactive for 30+ days
- **Large projects**: Over 1GB reclaimable
- **Specific ecosystem**: Just Node.js, just Rust, etc.

## Preview Before Cleaning

Before any deletion, Cluttered shows:

- Total space to be recovered
- Number of projects affected
- Warnings for active projects
- List of artifacts to be removed

**Always review this screen.** It's your last chance to exclude projects.

## Trash-First Deletion

Cluttered never permanently deletes files immediately:

1. Files are moved to your system Trash
2. macOS keeps Trash for 30 days by default
3. You can recover any file from Trash
4. Empty Trash when you're confident

### Why Trash?

This approach means:
- Mistakes are recoverable
- You have a 30-day safety window
- No special "undo" system needed
- Works with macOS conventions

## What Gets Cleaned

Cluttered only removes **regenerable artifacts**:

| Cleaned | Never Touched |
|---------|---------------|
| node_modules | package.json |
| target/ (Rust) | Cargo.toml |
| venv/ | requirements.txt |
| DerivedData | Source files |
| build/ | Configuration |

Your source code, configuration files, and lockfiles are always preserved.

## Cleaning Specific Artifacts

By default, selecting a project cleans all its artifacts. To clean selectively:

1. Click the project card to expand it
2. Uncheck artifacts you want to keep
3. Proceed with cleaning

This is useful when you want to clean `node_modules` but keep `.next` cache.

## Post-Cleanup Recovery

If you need to restore:

### From Trash

1. Open Finder → Go → Go to Folder
2. Enter `~/.Trash`
3. Find your artifacts
4. Drag back to original location

### By Reinstalling

Most artifacts can be regenerated:

```bash
# Node.js
npm install

# Rust
cargo build

# Python
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Go
go mod download
```

## Cleaning History

Cluttered keeps a log of all cleaning operations:

- **When**: Date and time of cleanup
- **What**: Projects and artifacts cleaned
- **How much**: Space recovered
- **Status**: Whether items are still in Trash

Access history from the **History** tab in the sidebar.

## Automation (Pro)

Pro users can automate cleaning:

### Scheduled Scans

Set Cluttered to scan automatically:
- Daily, weekly, or monthly
- At a specific time
- When disk space is low

### Auto-Clean Rules

Configure rules like:
- "Clean projects inactive for 60+ days"
- "Clean when reclaimable space exceeds 10GB"
- "Notify but don't auto-clean active projects"

## Best Practices

1. **Start with dormant projects**: Red indicators mean 30+ days inactive
2. **Review before cleaning**: Always check the preview
3. **Don't empty Trash immediately**: Wait a few days
4. **Clean regularly**: Weekly cleaning prevents large accumulations
5. **Trust the safety features**: Cluttered warns you for a reason
