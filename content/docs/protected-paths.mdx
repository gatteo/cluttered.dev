## Overview

Protected paths are directories that Cluttered will never suggest for cleaning, regardless of their content or activity status.

Use this feature for:

- Critical production projects
- Shared codebases
- Projects with unusual structures
- Directories you never want touched

## Adding Protected Paths

### From the UI

1. Open Cluttered preferences (⌘,)
2. Go to the "Protected" tab
3. Click "Add Path"
4. Select the directory to protect
5. Click "Save"

### From the Scan Results

1. Right-click on a project in the results
2. Select "Protect this path"
3. The project will be hidden from future scans

## How Protection Works

When a path is protected:

- It won't appear in scan results
- Its subdirectories are also protected
- You can still manually navigate to it in Finder

Protection is applied before scanning, so protected directories aren't even analyzed.

## Default Protected Paths

Cluttered automatically protects certain system paths:

- `/System/` - macOS system files
- `/Library/` - System library
- `~/Library/` - User library (mostly)
- `/.Trash/` - System trash
- `/Volumes/` - External drives (by default)

## Removing Protection

To stop protecting a path:

1. Open Cluttered preferences
2. Go to the "Protected" tab
3. Find the path in the list
4. Click the remove button (✕)

The directory will appear in the next scan.

## Best Practices

1. **Protect production directories**: If you have a critical app running from a directory, protect it
2. **Use sparingly**: Too many protected paths reduce Cluttered's effectiveness
3. **Review periodically**: Remove protection from paths you no longer need
4. **Consider git protection**: Remember, Cluttered already protects projects with uncommitted changes
