## Your First Scan

After [installing Cluttered](/docs/installation), you're ready to reclaim some disk space.

### Step 1: Open Cluttered

Launch Cluttered from your Applications folder or Spotlight.

### Step 2: Start a Scan

Click the "Scan" button in the main window. Cluttered will search your home directory for development projects.

The scan typically takes 10-30 seconds depending on how many projects you have.

### Step 3: Review Results

After scanning, you'll see a list of detected projects with:

- **Project name and path**
- **Activity indicator** (green = active, yellow = idle, red = dormant)
- **Reclaimable space** per project
- **Artifact breakdown** (node_modules, build folders, etc.)

### Step 4: Select What to Clean

Click on projects to select them for cleaning. Cluttered shows you:

- Total space to be recovered
- Number of projects selected
- Safety warnings (if any)

**Tip**: Focus on red (dormant) projects first—these are safest to clean.

### Step 5: Clean

Click "Clean Selected" to remove the artifacts. Everything goes to Trash first, so you can recover if needed.

## Understanding Activity Indicators

Cluttered uses color-coded indicators to help you identify safe cleanup targets:

| Color | Meaning | Safe to Clean? |
|-------|---------|----------------|
| 🟢 Green | Active in last 7 days | Use caution |
| 🟡 Yellow | Active in last 30 days | Usually safe |
| 🔴 Red | Dormant (30+ days) | Very safe |

## What Gets Cleaned

When you clean a project, Cluttered removes only build artifacts—never your source code:

- `node_modules/` - npm dependencies
- `target/` - Rust build output
- `DerivedData/` - Xcode caches
- `__pycache__/` - Python bytecode
- And many more...
