## Safety Philosophy

Cluttered is designed with one core principle: **never lose your work**.

Every feature is built around this goal. We'd rather miss a cleanup opportunity than risk damaging your projects.

## Git Integration

Cluttered integrates with git to protect your uncommitted work:

### What We Check

- **Uncommitted changes**: Files modified but not committed
- **Untracked files**: New files not yet added to git
- **Stashed changes**: Work saved with `git stash`

### How It Works

Before suggesting cleanup for any git repository, Cluttered runs the equivalent of:

```bash
git status --porcelain
```

If there are any changes, the project is marked as "has changes" and you'll see a warning before cleaning.

## Activity Detection

Beyond git, Cluttered uses multiple signals to determine if a project is active:

1. **File modification times**: When were project files last changed?
2. **Editor signals**: Is VS Code or another editor currently open?
3. **Process detection**: Are build processes running?
4. **Lock files**: Are there active npm/cargo/etc. processes?

## Trash-First Deletion

Everything Cluttered deletes goes to your system Trash first:

- ✅ You can undo any deletion
- ✅ Files stay in Trash until you empty it
- ✅ Familiar macOS behavior

We never use `rm -rf` or permanent deletion.

## What We Never Touch

Cluttered has a strict allowlist of what it will clean:

**Safe to clean:**
- `node_modules/`
- `target/` (Rust)
- `DerivedData/` (Xcode)
- Build output folders
- Cache directories

**Never touched:**
- Source code files
- Configuration files
- `.git/` directories
- Documentation
- Anything not on our allowlist

## Warnings and Confirmations

Before any cleanup, Cluttered shows you:

1. Exactly what will be deleted
2. Total size to be recovered
3. Warnings for active projects
4. A confirmation dialog

You're always in control.

## Recovery

If something goes wrong:

1. Open Finder
2. Go to Trash
3. Find the deleted files (sorted by deletion date)
4. Right-click and select "Put Back"

Files are restored to their original location.

## Reporting Issues

If Cluttered ever suggests cleaning something it shouldn't:

1. Don't proceed with the cleanup
2. Take a screenshot
3. Report the issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/cluttered-dev/cluttered/issues)

We take false positives seriously and will fix them immediately.
