## How Scanning Works

When you click "Scan," Cluttered traverses your selected directories looking for development projects. It uses intelligent detection to identify projects across 12+ ecosystems.

## What Gets Scanned

By default, Cluttered scans your home directory, focusing on common development locations:

- `~/Developer`
- `~/Projects`
- `~/Code`
- `~/Sites`
- `~/Desktop` (for quick projects)
- `~/Documents` (for work projects)

### Custom Scan Paths

You can configure which directories to scan:

1. Open **Settings** (⌘,)
2. Go to **Scan Locations**
3. Add or remove directories

## Project Detection

Cluttered identifies projects by looking for ecosystem-specific marker files:

| Ecosystem | Detection Files |
|-----------|----------------|
| Node.js | `package.json` |
| Rust | `Cargo.toml` |
| Python | `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml` |
| Xcode | `*.xcodeproj`, `*.xcworkspace` |
| Go | `go.mod` |
| Java | `pom.xml`, `build.gradle` |

When a marker file is found, Cluttered catalogs the project and calculates the size of cleanable artifacts.

## Scan Results

After scanning, you'll see:

### Project Cards

Each detected project shows:

- **Name and path**: Where the project lives
- **Activity indicator**: Green (active), yellow (idle), red (dormant)
- **Reclaimable space**: Total size of cleanable artifacts
- **Ecosystem icons**: Which ecosystems are detected

### Activity Detection

Cluttered determines project activity by checking:

1. **Git history**: Recent commits in the repository
2. **File modifications**: Changes to source files
3. **Process detection**: Running dev servers or builds
4. **IDE markers**: VS Code workspace activity

### Artifact Breakdown

Click on a project to see:

- Individual artifact sizes (`node_modules`: 450MB, `.next`: 120MB)
- Last modification date per artifact
- Safety recommendations

## Scan Performance

Typical scan times:

| Projects | Approximate Time |
|----------|-----------------|
| 10-50 | 5-10 seconds |
| 50-200 | 10-30 seconds |
| 200+ | 30-60 seconds |

### Improving Scan Speed

- Exclude large non-project directories (like Downloads)
- Limit scan depth if you have deeply nested projects
- Use an SSD for faster filesystem access

## Excluding Directories

Some directories should never be scanned:

- System directories (`/System`, `/Library`)
- Application bundles (`*.app`)
- Backup directories (Time Machine)

Cluttered excludes these automatically, but you can add custom exclusions in Settings.

## Troubleshooting Scans

### "No projects found"

Check that:
- Your scan paths include development directories
- You have projects with recognizable marker files
- Excluded directories aren't too broad

### Scan seems stuck

Large directories with millions of files can slow scanning. Try:
- Excluding your Downloads folder
- Limiting scan to specific project directories
- Checking for permission issues

### Missing projects

Some projects might not be detected if:
- They use non-standard project structures
- Marker files are missing or renamed
- The ecosystem isn't yet supported

[Request a new ecosystem](https://github.com/gatteo/cluttered/issues) if yours is missing.
