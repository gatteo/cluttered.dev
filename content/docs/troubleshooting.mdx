## Common Issues

### Cluttered won't open

**Symptoms**: App bounces in dock then disappears, or nothing happens.

**Solutions**:

1. **Check macOS version**: Cluttered requires macOS 12 (Monterey) or later
2. **Try right-click → Open**: Bypasses Gatekeeper for first launch
3. **Check Console.app**: Look for crash logs under Cluttered
4. **Reinstall**: Download fresh from [cluttered.dev/download](/download)

### "App is damaged" warning

This usually means Gatekeeper is blocking the app:

```bash
# Remove quarantine flag
xattr -cr /Applications/Cluttered.app
```

Then try opening again.

### Scan finds no projects

**Possible causes**:

1. **Wrong scan location**: Check Settings → Scan Locations
2. **Projects are excluded**: Check Settings → Exclusions
3. **Non-standard structure**: Projects need marker files (package.json, etc.)
4. **Permission denied**: Cluttered needs access to those directories

**Try this**:
1. Add your project folder directly to scan locations
2. Ensure no overly broad exclusions
3. Check System Settings → Privacy → Full Disk Access

### Scan is very slow

**Normal scan times**:
- 10-50 projects: 5-10 seconds
- 50-200 projects: 10-30 seconds
- 200+ projects: 30-60 seconds

**If slower than expected**:

1. **Exclude large directories**: Downloads, external drives
2. **Check disk health**: Run `diskutil verifyVolume /`
3. **Limit scan depth**: In Settings → Scan Locations
4. **Close other disk-heavy apps**: Spotlight, backups

### Space not recovered after cleaning

**Check these**:

1. **Trash not emptied**: Files are in Trash until you empty it
2. **Finder not refreshed**: Press ⌘⇧. in Finder
3. **System reporting delay**: Storage info can lag by minutes

**Verify cleanup**:
```bash
# Check Trash size
du -sh ~/.Trash

# Check specific project
du -sh ~/projects/my-project/node_modules
```

### Projects showing wrong activity status

Activity detection uses:
- Git commit history
- File modification times
- Running processes
- VS Code workspace data

**If incorrect**:

1. **Git history missing**: Clone might not have full history
2. **File times reset**: Some tools reset modification times
3. **Process detection**: Make sure dev servers are running when scanning

### License not recognized

**Solutions**:

1. **Re-enter license**: Settings → License → Enter License Key
2. **Check internet**: License validation requires connectivity
3. **Contact support**: [support@cluttered.dev](mailto:support@cluttered.dev)

## Error Messages

### "Permission denied"

Cluttered needs access to scan directories.

**Fix**:
1. System Settings → Privacy & Security → Full Disk Access
2. Add Cluttered to the list
3. Restart Cluttered

### "Could not move to Trash"

The Trash might be full or permissions are wrong.

**Fix**:
```bash
# Check Trash permissions
ls -la ~/.Trash

# Fix permissions if needed
chmod 700 ~/.Trash
```

### "Project is currently in use"

A running process is using files in that project.

**Fix**:
1. Stop dev servers (`npm run dev`, etc.)
2. Close IDE windows for that project
3. Wait a few seconds and retry

## Reset Cluttered

If all else fails, reset to factory state:

### Soft Reset (keeps license)

1. Settings → Reset to Defaults
2. Restart Cluttered

### Full Reset

```bash
# Remove all Cluttered data
rm -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/Cluttered
rm -rf ~/Library/Preferences/dev.cluttered.plist
rm -rf ~/Library/Caches/dev.cluttered

# Then reinstall
```

**Note**: This removes your license. You'll need to re-enter it.
