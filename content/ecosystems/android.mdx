## Overview

Android development is notorious for massive build directories. Between Gradle caches, build outputs, and the Android SDK, a single project can consume several gigabytes—and that's before considering multiple build variants.

## What Cluttered Cleans

| Artifact | Description | Typical Size |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| `build/` | Compiled outputs per module | 200MB - 2GB |
| `.gradle/` | Gradle wrapper and cache | 100MB - 1GB |
| Generated APKs/AABs | Build outputs | 50MB - 500MB |
| Build cache | Incremental build data | 500MB - 3GB |

## Why Android Builds Get Large

Android projects accumulate space from:

- **Build variants**: Debug, release, and flavors multiply outputs
- **Gradle cache**: Downloaded dependencies and build cache
- **Generated code**: Data binding, Room, Dagger/Hilt
- **Resource processing**: Compiled resources for multiple densities

## Safety Considerations

Cluttered protects your Android projects by:

- Detecting running Gradle daemons
- Checking for active Android Studio processes
- Identifying recently built variants
- Preserving signed release builds

## Gradle Cache Management

The global Gradle cache (`~/.gradle`) is shared across projects. Cluttered helps you:

- Identify unused cached dependencies
- Clean old Gradle wrapper versions
- Remove stale daemon logs
- Clear build caches safely

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Will cleaning break my project?**

No. Run `./gradlew build` to rebuild. All source code and configurations remain intact.

**What about my signed APKs?**

Cluttered warns before cleaning directories containing signed builds. You can exclude specific outputs.

**Does it clean the Android SDK?**

Cluttered can identify unused SDK components and emulator images in Pro mode.
