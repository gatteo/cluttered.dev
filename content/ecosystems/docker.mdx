## Overview

Docker is essential for modern development, but those images and layers accumulate fast. A typical development machine can have 20-50GB tied up in Docker data—much of it from old images you no longer use.

## What Cluttered Cleans

| Artifact | Description | Typical Size |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| Unused images | Images not referenced by containers | 5GB - 30GB |
| Stopped containers | Containers that are no longer running | 100MB - 5GB |
| Dangling images | Layers from failed or replaced builds | 1GB - 10GB |
| Build cache | Cached layers from `docker build` | 2GB - 20GB |
| Unused volumes | Volumes not attached to containers | 500MB - 10GB |

## Why Docker Gets So Large

Docker's layered architecture is great for efficiency, but it leads to accumulation:

- **Image versions**: Every tag pulls new layers
- **Build iterations**: Failed builds leave dangling images
- **Base image updates**: Old versions aren't auto-removed
- **Multi-platform builds**: Buildx caches for multiple architectures

## Safety Considerations

Cluttered protects your Docker environment by:

- Only suggesting images not used by any container
- Preserving running containers
- Detecting commonly used base images
- Warning about recently pulled images

## Cluttered vs `docker system prune`

| Feature | `docker system prune` | Cluttered |
|---------|----------------------|-----------|
| Interactive selection | No | Yes |
| Preview before delete | Limited | Full preview |
| Undo capability | No | Via Trash |
| Smart detection | No | Yes |

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Will this affect my running containers?**

No. Cluttered only cleans stopped containers and unused images. Running containers and their images are always preserved.

**Can I recover deleted images?**

Docker images are cleaned directly (not via Trash), but you can always `docker pull` them again. Cluttered warns you before cleaning Docker resources.

**What about my docker-compose setups?**

Cluttered detects docker-compose.yml files and protects images referenced in active project directories.
