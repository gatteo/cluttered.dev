## Overview

.NET projects generate significant build outputs across multiple directories. Multi-project solutions multiply this, with each project having its own bin and obj folders for each build configuration.

## What Cluttered Cleans

| Artifact | Description | Typical Size |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| `bin/` | Compiled assemblies and dependencies | 50MB - 500MB |
| `obj/` | Intermediate build files | 50MB - 300MB |
| `.vs/` | Visual Studio settings and cache | 10MB - 200MB |
| `TestResults/` | Test output and coverage | 10MB - 100MB |
| `packages/` | Legacy NuGet packages | 100MB - 1GB |

## Why .NET Builds Get Large

.NET projects accumulate space from:

- **Build configurations**: Debug and Release each have separate outputs
- **Multi-targeting**: netstandard, net6.0, net8.0 multiply outputs
- **Self-contained deployments**: Include entire runtime
- **Solution size**: Large solutions have many bin/obj directories

## Safety Considerations

Cluttered protects your .NET projects by:

- Detecting running dotnet processes
- Checking for active Visual Studio sessions
- Identifying recently built configurations
- Preserving published outputs

## Framework Support

| Framework | Detection | Clean Support |
|-----------|-----------|---------------|
| .NET Core/5+ | *.csproj with SDK | Full |
| .NET Framework | *.csproj legacy | Full |
| .NET MAUI | .maui workload | Full |
| Blazor | Blazor SDK | Full |

## Build Commands Comparison

| Action | dotnet CLI | Cluttered |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| Clean project | `dotnet clean` | Visual selection |
| Clean solution | `dotnet clean sln` | One-click |
| Deep clean | Manual | All at once |

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Will cleaning break my project?**

No. Run `dotnet build` to rebuild. Your source code and project files remain intact.

**What about the global NuGet cache?**

The `~/.nuget/packages` cache is shared. Cluttered Pro can analyze and clean unused packages.

**Does it clean Visual Studio caches?**

Project-level `.vs` directories can be cleaned. Global VS caches require explicit opt-in.
