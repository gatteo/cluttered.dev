## Overview

Elixir projects using Mix accumulate compiled BEAM bytecode, dependencies, and build artifacts. Phoenix projects additionally cache compiled assets and generated files.

## What Cluttered Cleans

| Artifact | Description | Typical Size |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| `_build/` | Compiled BEAM files | 50MB - 500MB |
| `deps/` | Hex dependencies | 50MB - 400MB |
| `.elixir_ls/` | ElixirLS language server cache | 10MB - 100MB |
| Asset cache | Phoenix compiled assets | 10MB - 100MB |

## Why Elixir Projects Get Large

Elixir projects accumulate space from:

- **Multiple build profiles**: dev, test, prod each have separate builds
- **Dependency compilation**: Every dep is compiled for your environment
- **Native extensions**: NIFs compile C/Rust code
- **Umbrella projects**: Each app has its own _build and deps

## Safety Considerations

Cluttered protects your Elixir projects by:

- Detecting running IEx sessions
- Checking for active Phoenix servers
- Identifying running supervision trees
- Preserving release artifacts

## Mix Commands Comparison

| Action | Mix Command | Cluttered |
|--------|------------|-----------|
| Clean build | `mix clean` | Visual selection |
| Clean deps | `mix deps.clean --all` | One-click |
| Full reset | Manual | All at once |

## Phoenix-Specific Cleanup

Phoenix projects have additional artifacts:

- **Asset cache**: Compiled esbuild/tailwind output
- **Generated files**: Gettext, migrations
- **Upload directories**: User-uploaded content (preserved by default)

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Will cleaning break my project?**

No. Run `mix deps.get && mix compile` to restore everything.

**What about my releases?**

Cluttered preserves `_build/prod/rel` by default. Release artifacts are protected.

**Does it handle umbrella projects?**

Yes! Cluttered detects umbrella structures and shows each app separately.
