## Overview

Go's module system and fast compilation are great for development, but the module cache and vendor directories can grow significantly over time, especially if you work on multiple projects.

## What Cluttered Cleans

| Artifact | Description | Typical Size |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| `vendor/` | Vendored dependencies | 50MB - 500MB |
| Local `bin/` | Compiled binaries | 10MB - 100MB |
| `pkg/` | Compiled packages | 20MB - 200MB |

## Go Module Cache

The Go module cache (`~/go/pkg/mod`) is shared across all projects. Cluttered can help you:

- Identify modules not used by any current project
- Find outdated versions of modules
- Clean test and build caches

## Why Go Artifacts Grow

- **Vendored dependencies**: Full copies in each project
- **Multiple module versions**: Different projects use different versions
- **Cross-compilation**: Builds for multiple OS/arch combinations
- **CGO dependencies**: C libraries compiled for Go

## Safety Considerations

Cluttered protects your Go projects by:

- Never cleaning go.mod or go.sum files
- Detecting running `go build` or `go test` processes
- Checking for recent file modifications
- Preserving actively developed modules

## Cleaning Commands Comparison

| Action | Go Command | Cluttered |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| Clean build cache | `go clean -cache` | Visual selection |
| Clean test cache | `go clean -testcache` | Visual selection |
| Clean module cache | `go clean -modcache` | Smart cleanup |
| Clean vendor | Manual | One-click |

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Will cleaning vendor/ break my build?**

Only if you're in an air-gapped environment. Run `go mod vendor` to restore.

**What about the global module cache?**

Cluttered Pro can analyze and clean the global `~/go/pkg/mod` cache, showing which modules are unused.

**Does it affect my GOPATH?**

Cluttered focuses on module-based projects. Legacy GOPATH setups are detected but handled carefully.
