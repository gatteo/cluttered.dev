## Overview

Java projects generate substantial build artifacts. Between Maven's target directories, Gradle's build outputs, and IDE-generated files, a single project can easily consume gigabytes of space.

## What Cluttered Cleans

| Artifact | Description | Typical Size |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| `target/` | Maven build output | 100MB - 1GB |
| `build/` | Gradle build output | 100MB - 1GB |
| `.gradle/` | Gradle cache and wrapper | 50MB - 500MB |
| `out/` | IntelliJ IDEA output | 50MB - 500MB |
| `.idea/` | IDE configuration | 10MB - 100MB |

## Why Java Builds Get Large

Java projects accumulate space from:

- **Compiled classes**: Every .java becomes .class files
- **Fat JARs**: Spring Boot bundles all dependencies
- **Multi-module projects**: Each module has its own target/build
- **Test outputs**: Compiled tests and reports

## Build Tool Support

| Tool | Detection | Clean Support |
|------|-----------|---------------|
| Maven | pom.xml | Full |
| Gradle | build.gradle | Full |
| Ant | build.xml | Partial |
| Bazel | BUILD | Partial |

## Safety Considerations

Cluttered protects your Java projects by:

- Detecting running JVM processes in project directories
- Checking for active Maven/Gradle builds
- Identifying recently modified source files
- Preserving release artifacts in designated directories

## Maven vs Gradle Cleanup

| Action | Maven | Gradle | Cluttered |
|--------|-------|--------|-----------|
| Clean build | `mvn clean` | `gradle clean` | One-click |
| Preserve deps | Not possible | Not possible | Yes |
| Multi-module | Per-module | Per-module | All at once |

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Will cleaning break my project?**

No. Run `mvn compile` or `gradle build` to rebuild. Source code is never touched.

**What about my local Maven repository?**

The `~/.m2/repository` is a shared cache. Cluttered Pro can analyze and clean unused dependencies.

**Does it clean IntelliJ caches?**

Project-level `.idea` and `out` directories can be cleaned. Global IDE caches require explicit opt-in.
