## Overview

Node.js projects are notorious for their massive `node_modules` directories. A single React project can easily have 500MB+ in dependencies, and if you work on multiple projects, this adds up quickly.

## What Cluttered Cleans

| Artifact | Description | Typical Size |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| `node_modules/` | All npm dependencies | 200MB - 2GB |
| `.next/` | Next.js build cache | 50MB - 500MB |
| `dist/` | TypeScript/Webpack output | 10MB - 100MB |
| `.turbo/` | Turborepo cache | 50MB - 500MB |

## Why These Get So Large

The JavaScript ecosystem has a deep dependency tree. A simple React app might have:
- 1,500+ packages in node_modules
- Hundreds of transitive dependencies
- Multiple copies of the same package at different versions

## Safety Considerations

Cluttered protects your Node.js projects by:

- Checking for uncommitted git changes
- Detecting active `npm run` processes
- Looking for recent `package-lock.json` modifications
- Identifying VS Code workspace activity

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Will cleaning node_modules break my project?**

No! Just run `npm install` to restore dependencies. All your code is untouched.

**Does Cluttered support pnpm and yarn?**

Yes! Cluttered detects all Node.js package managers and cleans appropriately.

**What about global npm packages?**

Cluttered only cleans project-local node_modules. Global packages are not touched.
