## Overview

PHP projects using Composer accumulate vendor directories with all their dependencies. Laravel and Symfony projects also generate significant cache data during development.

## What Cluttered Cleans

| Artifact | Description | Typical Size |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| `vendor/` | Composer dependencies | 50MB - 400MB |
| Framework caches | Laravel/Symfony caches | 10MB - 100MB |
| Compiled views | Blade/Twig compiled templates | 5MB - 50MB |
| Log files | Application logs | 10MB - 500MB |

## Why PHP Projects Get Large

PHP projects grow from:

- **Composer packages**: Full package sources with dev dependencies
- **Framework caches**: Route, config, and view caches
- **Autoloader optimization**: Compiled class maps
- **Development tools**: PHPUnit, PHPStan, Rector

## Safety Considerations

Cluttered protects your PHP projects by:

- Detecting running PHP servers (built-in, artisan serve)
- Checking for active queue workers
- Identifying recent composer.lock changes
- Preserving production cache configurations

## Framework Support

| Framework | Detection | Clean Support |
|-----------|-----------|---------------|
| Laravel | artisan file | Full |
| Symfony | symfony.lock | Full |
| WordPress | wp-config.php | Partial |
| Drupal | core/composer.json | Partial |

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Will cleaning vendor/ break my application?**

No. Run `composer install` to restore. Your composer.lock ensures exact versions.

**What about WordPress plugins?**

Cluttered treats wp-content/plugins as source code, not build artifacts. Only caches are cleaned.

**Does it clean opcache?**

PHP opcache is managed by the PHP runtime. Cluttered focuses on file-system artifacts.
