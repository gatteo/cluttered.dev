## Overview

Python projects accumulate virtual environments and cache directories quickly. A single data science project with numpy, pandas, and machine learning libraries can have a virtual environment exceeding 2GB.

## What Cluttered Cleans

| Artifact | Description | Typical Size |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| `venv/` / `.venv/` | Virtual environment directories | 200MB - 3GB |
| `__pycache__/` | Compiled Python bytecode | 10MB - 100MB |
| `.pytest_cache/` | pytest result cache | 5MB - 50MB |
| `.mypy_cache/` | Type checking cache | 10MB - 200MB |
| `*.egg-info/` | Package metadata | 1MB - 10MB |

## Why Virtual Environments Get Large

Python virtual environments contain:

- Complete copies of packages (not symlinks)
- Compiled C extensions (numpy, pandas)
- Multiple versions of dependencies
- Platform-specific binaries

A data science stack (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, tensorflow) can easily exceed 2GB.

## Safety Considerations

Cluttered protects your Python projects by:

- Detecting active Jupyter notebook sessions
- Checking for running Python processes
- Identifying recently modified .py files
- Respecting Poetry and Pipenv lockfiles

## Package Manager Support

| Manager | Detection | Clean Support |
|---------|-----------|---------------|
| pip + venv | requirements.txt | Full |
| Poetry | pyproject.toml | Full |
| Pipenv | Pipfile | Full |
| Conda | environment.yml | Partial |

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Will cleaning break my project?**

No! Your source code and dependency specifications (requirements.txt, pyproject.toml) are never touched. Just run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to restore.

**What about conda environments?**

Cluttered detects conda environments but handles them carefully since they can be shared across projects.

**Does it clean the global pip cache?**

By default, Cluttered focuses on project-local artifacts. Global pip cache cleaning is available in Pro.
