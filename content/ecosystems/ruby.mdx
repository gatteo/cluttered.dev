## Overview

Ruby projects, especially Rails applications, accumulate gem dependencies, caches, and logs over time. A mature Rails app can have hundreds of megabytes in vendor directories alone.

## What Cluttered Cleans

| Artifact | Description | Typical Size |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| `vendor/bundle/` | Bundled gem dependencies | 100MB - 800MB |
| `tmp/cache/` | Rails cache files | 10MB - 500MB |
| `log/` | Development and test logs | 10MB - 1GB |
| `coverage/` | Test coverage reports | 5MB - 50MB |
| `.bundle/` | Bundler configuration cache | 5MB - 20MB |

## Why Ruby Projects Get Large

Ruby projects accumulate space from:

- **Native extensions**: Compiled C extensions in gems
- **Asset pipeline**: Compiled and cached assets
- **Development logs**: Can grow unbounded
- **Test artifacts**: Coverage reports, screenshots

## Safety Considerations

Cluttered protects your Ruby projects by:

- Detecting running Rails servers
- Checking for active Sidekiq processes
- Identifying recent Gemfile.lock changes
- Preserving production-configured directories

## Rails-Specific Cleanup

| Artifact | Rails Command | Cluttered |
|----------|--------------|-----------|
| Logs | `rails log:clear` | Visual selection |
| Tmp files | `rails tmp:clear` | One-click |
| Assets | `rails assets:clobber` | Included |

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Will cleaning vendor/bundle break my app?**

No. Run `bundle install` to restore gems. Your Gemfile.lock ensures exact versions.

**What about the global gem directory?**

Cluttered focuses on project-local vendor directories. Global gem cleanup is available in Pro.

**Does it clean .rbenv or .rvm?**

These are treated as system directories and require explicit opt-in.
