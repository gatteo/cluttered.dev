## Overview

Rust's compilation model creates some of the largest build artifacts in any ecosystem. A single project's `target/` directory can easily exceed 10 GB, especially with multiple build profiles.

## What Cluttered Cleans

| Artifact | Description | Typical Size |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| `target/` | Compiled artifacts, deps, debug info | 2-10 GB |
| `target/debug/` | Debug build artifacts | 1-5 GB |
| `target/release/` | Release build artifacts | 500 MB - 2 GB |
| `.cargo/registry/cache` | Downloaded crate archives | 500 MB - 2 GB |

## Why Rust Builds Are So Large

Rust's compilation strategy includes:

- **Incremental compilation data**: Speeds up rebuilds but consumes space
- **Debug symbols**: Essential for debugging but very large
- **Dependency builds**: Each dependency is compiled separately
- **Multiple targets**: Each target (debug, release, tests) has separate artifacts

## Safety Considerations

Cluttered protects your Rust projects by:

- Checking for uncommitted git changes
- Detecting running `cargo build` or `cargo run` processes
- Looking for recent Cargo.lock modifications
- Identifying active editor sessions

## Restoring After Cleanup

After cleaning, simply run:

```bash
cargo build
```

Rust will recompile your dependencies and project. First build after cleanup will take longer, but subsequent builds use incremental compilation.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Will cleaning break my binaries?**

If you clean `target/release/`, the compiled binary is removed. You'll need to rebuild. Your source code is always safe.

**What about cargo install binaries?**

Cluttered doesn't touch globally installed binaries in `~/.cargo/bin`. Only project-local targets are cleaned.

**Should I clean the registry cache?**

The registry cache speeds up dependency downloads. Clean it if you need space; Cargo will re-download as needed.
