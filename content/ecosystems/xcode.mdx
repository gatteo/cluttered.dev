## Overview

Xcode is one of the most disk-hungry development environments. Between DerivedData, module caches, and iOS Simulator data, Apple developers often have 50+ GB consumed without realizing it.

## What Cluttered Cleans

| Artifact | Description | Typical Size |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| `DerivedData/` | Build products and indexes | 5-20 GB |
| `ModuleCache/` | Precompiled module headers | 1-5 GB |
| `Archives/` | Archived builds for distribution | 1-10 GB |
| `iOS DeviceSupport/` | Device debug symbols | 5-15 GB |
| Simulator Data | Unused simulator runtimes | 5-20 GB |

## Why Xcode Uses So Much Space

Xcode's aggressive caching strategy includes:

- **Indexing data**: Full source code index for autocomplete
- **Module caches**: Precompiled Swift/Objective-C modules
- **Build intermediates**: Object files, asset catalogs
- **Device support**: Debug symbols for every iOS version tested

## Global vs Project Locations

DerivedData is typically stored in one of two locations:

1. **Default**: `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/`
2. **Relative to project**: `./DerivedData/` (if configured)

Cluttered scans both locations automatically.

## Safety Considerations

Cluttered protects your Apple projects by:

- Checking for uncommitted git changes
- Detecting if Xcode is running with the project open
- Identifying recent `.xcuserstate` modifications
- Preserving active Archives for App Store submission

## Restoring After Cleanup

After cleaning DerivedData:

1. Open your project in Xcode
2. Build (⌘B) - Xcode will regenerate everything
3. First build will take longer; subsequent builds are fast

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Is it safe to delete DerivedData?**

Yes! This is one of the first things Apple Support recommends when troubleshooting Xcode issues.

**Will I lose my Archives?**

Cluttered shows Archives separately and asks for confirmation before cleaning them. These are needed for App Store submissions.

**What about simulator data?**

Unused simulator runtimes can be safely removed. Active simulators are preserved.
